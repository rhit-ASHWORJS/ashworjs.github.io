            <h2><a href="#">Pixy Camera</a></h2>
            <img src="images\pixy.jpg" />
            <p>During my time at High School in FIRST Robotics, I programmed a system that used cameras to automatically
                play the game.  It used a pair of PIXY cameras on the robot to locate the came objects, pick them up, target
                the goal, and automatically fire.

            <h2><a href="#">FANUC Hangman</a></h2>
            <img src="images\robot.jpg" />
            <p>As mentioned in the about page, I worked with a FANUC robotic arm during my time in High School.  I used this 
                arm to play hangman against a human opponent, and it would flash lights at the player if they lost.

            <h2><a href="#">NKFL Navigation</a></h2>
            <img src="images\NKFLresearch.jpg" />
            <p>During my time at Rose Hulman, I began doing research with Dr. Yoder on navigating through NK fitness landscapes.
                An NK fitness landscape is a way to model the fitness of a given bitstring 'genome', where the chromosomes actually
                depend on each other and effect their fitness, rather than the more standard approach where each chromosome acts independently.

            <h2><a href="#">CNC Minimill</a></h2>
            <img src="images\minimill.jpg" />
            <p>A final experience I have had has been working with CNC minimills for automated manufacturing.  I used these minimills to create
                precisely manufactured objects such as an aluminium Turner's Cube, a piece of rock with my initials engraved into it, and a small
                drawing of a formula 1 car.
