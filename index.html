            <li><p>My name is Jacob Ashworth and I come from a (relatively) small town in Plymouth, Wisconsin.
                When I was in High School I joined FIRST Robotics on team 3418 (RoboRiot).  There I learned
                about Computer Programming, which I quickly decided was what I wanted to do for the future.
                I spend the next couple years before college on various programming projects, one of which was 
                making an industrial robotic arm play 'hangman' against a human opponent, which went so well that
                Lab Midwest invited me to a webinar to talk to me about my industrial robotics expereince!
            </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    After High School I began attending the Rose-Hulman institute of technology, where I continued
                    to study computer science.  I took classes such as Intro to Digital System, Data Structures and
                    Algorithm Analysis, Computer Architecture I, and Operating Systems.  Over the summer between Freshman
                    and Sophomore year I was an intern at Direct Supply, where I was introduced to the greater world of 
                    Software Engineering, and used technologies such as GitLab CI/CD, SQL, C# and Web Interfacing, and
                    interfacing between Databases and Website Backend.
